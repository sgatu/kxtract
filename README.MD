# KXtract

**KXtract** is a precision-focused Kafka data extraction tool designed for developers and analysts who need exact, verifiable slices of Kafka history.

It provides **forensic-level extraction** by combining binary search over Kafka offsets with granular data filters to isolate only the records you need.

Built in Go, KXtract aims for high performance, minimal dependencies, and compressed CSV output for efficient storage and sharing.

Use it to debug event anomalies, audit message flows, or export specific data windows with surgical precision.

*Work in progress — built to learn, built to last.*
